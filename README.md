# ISMS-Implementation
Home Lab Project-> ISMS Implementation Exercise for a Simulated SMB

Company Background:
Bayside Insurance Brokers, a trusted name on Queensland’s Gold Coast, has built its reputation on providing personalized service and reliable advice. For years, they’ve served individuals and local businesses, offering a range of insurance products from home and car to business and travel coverage.

Existing Security Measures:
Mindful of the increasing cyber threat, the management team at Bayside Insurance had taken what they believed were appropriate steps to protect their business and their clients' sensitive data. They had a basic firewall in place, used an email filtering service, and had provided their staff with annual security awareness training. They also relied on the security measures provided by their cloud-based CRM vendor, a popular solution in the industry.

The First Warning Sign- A Phishing Scare:
The first sign that something amiss came in late 2024. A staff member in accounts, Sarah, received an email that looked remarkably like an invoice from their long-time stationery supplier, "Office Supplies Direct." The email requested an urgent payment, citing a change in banking details.

Although Sarah had attended the company’s annual security training, she was under pressure to process invoices quickly. The email looked legitimate, and the amount wasn’t unusually high. She clicked the link, entered her credentials, and authorized the payment.

Fortunately, the bank's fraud detection system flagged the transaction as suspicious, and the payment was blocked. However, Sarah's credentials had been compromised.

A Close Call, but a Lesson Learned:
The near miss prompted a review of the company's security. They implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for email and online banking. They also provided staff with a refresher on phishing awareness, emphasizing the need to verify all payment requests.

The Storm Hits- A Ransomware Attack on the CRM System:
Despite the enhanced security measures, disaster struck a few months later. On a quiet Sunday morning, the CRM system became unresponsive. The IT support contractor discovered that the system had been hit by a ransomware attack. All customer data – policy details, claims information, financial records – was encrypted. A ransom note demanded a significant payment in Bitcoin for the decryption key.

The Aftermath:
Bayside was unable to access customer data, halting all business operations. Brokers couldn’t provide quotes, process claims, or access policy information. Customers were frustrated and anxious. The phone lines were jammed with inquiries.

The company contacted their CRM provider, who confirmed that they had experienced a security breach affecting multiple customers. The provider's security team was working to restore the system, but the timeline was uncertain.

The Crisis Management Response:
Bayside activated its (limited) incident response plan. They notified their cyber insurance provider and engaged a specialist cybersecurity firm to assist with the recovery. They also had to consider their obligations under the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme and the Privacy Act.

The Cost of the Attack:
The ransomware attack had a significant impact on Bayside:
•	Business Interruption: The company was unable to operate for five days, resulting in lost revenue.
•	Recovery Costs: They incurred significant expenses for incident response, data recovery, and legal advice.
•	Reputational Damage: The attack damaged their reputation and eroded customer trust. Several clients threatened to take their business elsewhere.
•	Potential Fines: They faced the possibility of regulatory fines for failing to adequately protect customer data.

The Turning Point- Implementing an ISMS:
The ransomware attack was a wake-up call for Bayside. They realized that their existing security measures were inadequate and that they needed a more comprehensive approach to information security.

The Decision to Implement an ISMS:
After carefully considering their options, Bayside decided to implement an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on ISO 27001. They recognized that this would provide a structured framework for managing their information security risks and protecting their critical assets.

And I got appointed as ISMS Specialist to enable this implementation.
